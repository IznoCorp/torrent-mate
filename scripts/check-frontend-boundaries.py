"""Refuses the defect classes that let a module tree rot — one arm each.

Corpus: `frontend/maquette/design/src`, every `.ts`, `.tsx` and `.js` file.
**The production app under `frontend/src` is deliberately NOT read** — it is
ARCHIVED at switchover (`product-intent.md` §15), so a guard over it would
hold an object about to stop existing. That is the operator's arbitration of
2026-08-22, and it is the same carve-out the French guard already makes.

ARM `cycles` — an import cycle.

THE DEFECT CLASS. A cycle makes every other dependency rule unenforceable,
because the cycle *is* the violation: once A needs B and B needs A, no
statement about layering, ownership or fan-in can be true of either. It also
fails at runtime in a way that reads as anything but a cycle — one of the two
modules evaluates against a half-built namespace, so a binding is `undefined`
at exactly the moment something reads it.

Two lived here, and what they were is worth keeping. `data.ts` imported the
panel component for ONE type, and the panel component imported `data.ts` back
for its own — while a byte-identical declaration of that same type already
sat in `seams.ts`. The cycle's whole substance was a duplicate. The second
was a screen importing the navigation verb from the shell that renders that
screen; the verb knew only a path, so it belonged with the domain-free
helpers and never with the shell.

A TYPE-ONLY EDGE COUNTS. `import type` is erased at runtime, so a cycle made
of them cannot fail at boot — and it is still refused here, deliberately. It
is the shape both of the cycles above actually had, it says the same thing
about ownership that a value edge says, and « this one is only types » is an
exemption that would have kept both.

WHAT THE READER SEES, and it is the question worth asking of any guard: it
resolves every RELATIVE specifier — `import … from`, `export … from`, and a
bare side-effect `import "./x"`, which is a real edge and spells itself with
no `from` at all. A bare specifier (`react`, `@tanstack/store`) is not a
local edge and is ignored. Resolution tries the literal path, then the four
source extensions, then `/index.*`, and finally the `.js`-means-`.ts` form
the TypeScript bundler resolution uses — the engine imports its seam that
way, and a resolver blind to it would report a missing target as no edge at
all, which is the silent half of this failure mode.

An UNRESOLVED relative specifier is reported as its own violation rather than
dropped. A specifier that resolves to nothing is a broken import; counting it
as « no edge » is how a reader stays green over a tree it cannot read.

Exit code: 0 when every arm run is clean, 1 otherwise.
