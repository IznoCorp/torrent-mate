"""AcquireContext — frozen injection handle for the acquisition lobe (RP5c).

Mirrors the ``AppContext`` pattern: a frozen dataclass constructed once at
the composition root and carrying the owned/borrowed service handles needed
by the acquisition lobe.

Import direction: this module imports only from ``personalscraper.api`` and
``personalscraper.acquire`` — never from triage packages.

    """Frozen injection handle for the acquisition lobe.

    Constructed once per process at the composition root (inside
    ``_build_app_context``) and stored as ``AppContext.acquire``.

    Ownership semantics:
    - ``tracker_registry``: OWNED — RP5a port, migrated from ``AppContext``.
      ``close()`` will call ``tracker_registry.close()``.
    - ``store``: OWNED (when present) — filled by RP3; ``close()`` propagates.
    - ``delete_authority``: BORROWED (stateless) — built at the same boundary
      as ``store``; borrows the store handle (no lifecycle of its own).
      ``close()`` does NOT touch ``delete_authority`` — it has no ``close()``
      method and owns no resources.
    - ``torrent_client``: BORROWED — shared with ``ingest``; its lifecycle is
      managed by the ``ingest`` boundary, NOT here. ``close()`` must NOT call
      ``torrent_client.close()``.

    Attributes:
        tracker_registry: Configured ``TrackerRegistry`` (always present at
            boot; may be empty when all trackers are disabled).
        store: ``AcquireStore`` implementation or ``None``.  Slot filled by
            RP3 when the acquisition DB is wired.
        delete_authority: ``DeleteAuthority`` or ``None``.  Stateless resolver
            that borrows the store — fail-open when store is ``None``.
        torrent_client: Active torrent client or ``None``.  Borrowed from
            the shared port — ``close()`` does not own its lifecycle.
        grab: ``GrabCore`` sub-handle (orchestrator + acquisition service) or
            ``None``.  Built by ``_factory.build_acquire_context`` only when a
            ``torrent_client`` is present (``None`` for read-only / dry-run
            commands).  Owns no closeable resource of its own — the bus is
            borrowed and the store / registry lifecycles are owned here —
            so ``close()`` does NOT touch it.

            honor the same contract or its exception will propagate.
