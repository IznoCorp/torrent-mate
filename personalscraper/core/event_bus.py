"""In-process typed event bus — Sub-phase 1.4 layer.

This module is the single substrate for cross-component asynchronous
communication in PersonalScraper. Layers landed so far:

- 1.1: ``Event`` frozen base + ``current_correlation_id`` ContextVar.
- 1.2: ``SubscriptionToken`` + ``EventBus.subscribe`` / ``unsubscribe`` with
       copy-on-write subscriber storage.
- 1.3: ``EventBus.emit`` with MRO-walking dispatch, an MRO cache, and the
       no-subscribers zero-allocation fast path (DESIGN §Performance notes).
- 1.4: per-subscriber ``try/except Exception`` error isolation,
       ``event_emit_failed`` structlog WARNING, immutable-snapshot iteration
       (re-entrant ``subscribe`` / ``unsubscribe`` / ``emit`` are all safe).

Subsequent sub-phases extend this module with JSON serialization (1.5–1.6)
and the event class registry hooked via ``Event.__init_subclass__`` (1.6).
See ``docs/features/event-bus/plan/phase-01-foundation.md``.
