# Event Bus — reference

The in-process event bus is the runtime spine that connects pipeline,
indexer, scraper, dispatcher, and trailer components to their
subscribers (RichConsole, Telegram, structured debug log, future Web
UI). This document is the **how**; for the **why**, design rationale,
and rollback discipline see
[`docs/features/event-bus/DESIGN.md`](../features/event-bus/DESIGN.md).

## Purpose & high-level architecture

The bus replaces the pre-0.13 `PipelineObserver` / `StepEvent`
duck-typed registry with a typed dataclass-event bus organised around
five primitives:

- **`Event`** — frozen, keyword-only dataclass base in
  `personalscraper.core.event_bus`. Carries four
  framework-managed fields (`timestamp`, `event_id`, `source`,
  `correlation_id`). Concrete events subclass it.
- **`EventBus`** — the multicast dispatcher. Each emit walks the
  event's MRO; every registered callback for an ancestor type is
  invoked. Subscriber registration uses a copy-on-write tuple per
  type, so callbacks added mid-emit do not see the in-flight event.
- **`SubscriptionToken`** — opaque handle returned by `subscribe`,
  required by `unsubscribe` for clean teardown.
- **`event_to_dict` / `event_to_envelope` / `event_from_envelope`** —
  JSON-safe serialization helpers. Envelopes carry a `_type` discriminator
  so subscribers persisting events (e.g. an outbox queue) can round-trip
  the exact class without reflection.
- **`current_correlation_id`** — `ContextVar[str | None]` captured at
  event construction time. Long-lived emitters (singletons, breakers
  outside a pipeline run) inherit the calling run's correlation id
  automatically.

The bus is process-scoped: every CLI invocation builds one
`AppContext`, the AppContext holds one `EventBus`, and every component
that emits or subscribes shares that bus by dependency injection. There
is no module-level singleton in the production path — every emit site
takes `event_bus: EventBus` as a required keyword argument (Sub-phase
5.1 + 5.2 closed every `| None` migration site).

## API reference

Every public symbol of the bus lives in
`personalscraper.core.event_bus`. The module is intentionally narrow:
the three runtime primitives (`Event`, `EventBus`, `SubscriptionToken`),
the four serialization helpers (`event_to_dict`, `event_to_envelope`,
`event_from_envelope`, plus the `_EVENT_CLASS_REGISTRY` populated by
event-module imports), and the `current_correlation_id` ContextVar.

The import surface intentionally matches what subscribers and emitters
need — there are no helper factories, no event registry mutators, no
async variants. New API symbols require updating the v1 catalog
section above and bumping the registry pin in the gate.

```python
from personalscraper.core.event_bus import (
    Event,
    EventBus,
    SubscriptionToken,
    current_correlation_id,
    event_to_dict,
    event_to_envelope,
    event_from_envelope,
)
```

The sub-sections below document each entry point. Behaviour that
differs between subscribe-time and emit-time (e.g. the MRO cache
build) is called out explicitly so callers know which cost lives
where. Every assertion below is pinned by at least one test under
`tests/event_bus/` or `tests/core/test_circuit_events.py`.

### `EventBus.subscribe(event_type, callback) -> SubscriptionToken`

Register `callback(event)` for every emit whose runtime class is
`event_type` **or any subclass**. The MRO walk happens at emit time,
not at subscribe time, so a subscription to `Event` catches every
concrete event class (used by `DebugLogSubscriber`).

### `EventBus.unsubscribe(token: SubscriptionToken) -> None`

Remove the subscription identified by `token`. Idempotent: a second
call is a no-op. Tokens issued for already-removed subscriptions stay
inert.

### `EventBus.emit(event: Event) -> None`

Synchronously invoke every callback registered for any class in the
event's MRO. Callback order is concrete-class-first then ancestor types,
FIFO within each class — so a subscriber on `Event` runs after subscribers
on `event.__class__` for the same emit (see `_resolve_mro_chain` in
`personalscraper/core/event_bus.py`). A callback that
raises is logged at `WARNING` (`event_emit_failed`) and isolated:
later subscribers still receive the event. Re-entrant emits (a
callback that calls `bus.emit` again) are supported — each emit gets
its own snapshot of the subscriber tuple.

### `Event` base fields

| Field            | Type          | Default behaviour                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `timestamp`      | `datetime`    | Auto-set in `__post_init__` to `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`.      |
| `event_id`       | `UUID`        | Auto-set to `uuid.uuid4()` in `__post_init__`.                    |
| `source`         | `str`         | Auto-derived from the class's module path (overridable per emit). |
| `correlation_id` | `str \| None` | Captured from `current_correlation_id` at construction time.      |

Every concrete event class is `@dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True)`
and inherits these four fields. Subclasses add their domain payload.

### `event_to_dict(event) -> dict[str, Any]`

Recursively coerce dataclasses, paths, UUIDs, datetimes, enums, and
nested mappings into JSON-safe primitives. Use this when you want the
payload **without** the `_type` discriminator — e.g. debug logging.

### `event_to_envelope(event) -> dict[str, Any]`

Wrap `event_to_dict(event)` under a `"data"` key alongside a top-level
`_type` discriminator equal to `type(event).__name__`. The envelope shape
is exactly `{"_type": <class-name>, "data": {<payload>}}` — the payload
is **nested**, never flattened. The envelope is what subscribers persist
to an outbox / write to a wire protocol.

### `event_from_envelope(envelope: dict) -> Event`

Inverse of `event_to_envelope`. Looks up `envelope["_type"]` in
`_EVENT_CLASS_REGISTRY` (populated at import time by every event
module), reads the payload from `envelope["data"]`, and reconstructs
the instance. Raises `KeyError` (fail-loud) when `envelope["_type"]`
is not in the registry.

### `current_correlation_id: ContextVar[str | None]`

Bind a per-run correlation id with the standard `ContextVar` pattern:

```python
token = current_correlation_id.set(run_id)
try:
    ...
finally:
    current_correlation_id.reset(token)
```

Every `Event(...)` constructed inside the `try` block captures
`run_id` in its `correlation_id` field — including emits from
long-lived breakers / orchestrators that pre-existed the run.

## Event catalog (v1)

The v1 catalog defines exactly 13 production event classes, all
imported eagerly by `personalscraper.events` so they self-register
before any envelope round-trip.

| Class                      | Module                            | Payload fields                                                                                       | Producer                                                                                           |

The set is pinned by `test_event_bus/test_event_registry.py::test_v1_catalog_matches_expected_13_events`; adding a new event requires extending both the registry and the test assertion in the same commit.

## Boundary-only AppContext rule

`AppContext` is a frozen dataclass holding the three process-scoped
singletons (`config`, `settings`, `event_bus`). The rule landed in
Phase 2: only **CLI / launchd boundaries** are allowed to construct
one. Domain modules receive what they need through their own
constructor / function parameters; passing `AppContext` deeper is a
design violation.

The rule is enforced by `tests/architecture/test_app_context_boundary.py`
(landed in Sub-phase 2.6): an AST allowlist scan walks every source
file, finds every `_build_app_context` call, and asserts it lives in a
function listed in the allowlist. Currently the allowlist contains:

- `personalscraper.cli_helpers._build_app_context` (the constructor)
- `personalscraper.cli.callback` (the typer top-level callback)
- `personalscraper.commands.pipeline.run` (the full-pipeline CLI)
- `personalscraper.commands.library.scan.library_index` (the launchd command)
- the four `personalscraper.trailers.cli.*` subcommands

To add a new boundary, append its qualified name to the allowlist in
`tests/architecture/test_app_context_boundary.py` and write a short
justification in the commit body — the AST test fails on every other
construction site, including indirect ones through helpers.

## JSON serialization contract

Subscribers that persist events (the indexer outbox, future WebSocket
relay) need a deterministic JSON shape. The contract:

| Value kind          | Encoded as                                                                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `datetime`          | ISO-8601 string with timezone (`2026-05-12T14:23:11+00:00`)                |
| `UUID`              | Plain string (`5e4c8b3d-...`)                                              |
| `Path`              | Plain string (POSIX, never `repr`)                                         |
| `Enum`              | The member's `.value`                                                      |
| dataclass instances | Recursive `event_to_dict` (no `_type`); fields preserved in declared order |
| `list` / `tuple`    | JSON array (tuples collapse to arrays)                                     |
| `dict`              | JSON object; keys coerced via `str()` if not already strings               |
| `None`              | JSON `null`                                                                |
| Anything else       | `repr(value)` — fail-safe so a forgotten coercion still serialises         |

`event_to_dict(event)` produces a flat dict with the event's domain
fields plus the four base fields. `event_to_envelope(event)` wraps that
flat dict under a `"data"` key and adds a top-level `_type` discriminator:

```json
{
  "_type": "PipelineStarted",
  "data": {
    "timestamp": "2026-05-12T16:23:11+00:00",
    "event_id": "5e4c8b3d-d6c4-43d3-bc0e-7f5a9b8c1234",
    "source": "personalscraper.pipeline_events.PipelineStarted",
    "correlation_id": "run-20260512T1623",
    "report": { ... }
  }
}
```

**Decision guide.** Use `event_to_dict` for transient logging
(`DebugLogSubscriber`); use `event_to_envelope` whenever the receiver
needs to round-trip back to a concrete class
(`event_from_envelope`). The indexer outbox uses envelopes; the
debug log uses dicts.

## current_correlation_id ContextVar convention

`current_correlation_id` is a Python `contextvars.ContextVar[str |
None]` that every `Event.__post_init__` reads to populate the
`correlation_id` field. The ContextVar is scoped per asyncio task /
per thread, so emitting from inside a `ThreadPoolExecutor` worker
inherits the parent thread's binding automatically — provided the
binding is set before the executor is launched.

The bind/reset pattern is the same in every boundary; only the
binding scope differs. The four scenarios below cover every emitter
in the pipeline.

The key invariant: **bind once at the run boundary, reset once at
the end**. Never bind inside a domain function — that scopes the
correlation id to that function only, and breakers that emit from
inside a deeper call stack will not see it. Every CLI boundary
listed in the AppContext allowlist (§Boundary-only rule above)
binds the ContextVar; deeper code never touches it.

A subtler point: `current_correlation_id.get()` returns `None` when
no binding is active (e.g. during module import, smoke tests). The
`Event.__post_init__` stores `None` faithfully — `correlation_id`
is `str | None`, not `str`, precisely so the test envelope still
round-trips when no run is bound.

### CLI bootstrap (`personalscraper run`)

The actual bind/reset lives **inside** `Pipeline.run` (see
`personalscraper/pipeline.py:225` for `set` and `:370` for `reset`), not
in the CLI command itself. The CLI command is a thin wrapper that
constructs `AppContext`, instantiates subscribers, and calls
`pipeline.run(...)`; the ContextVar lifecycle is one layer down so
every event constructed during the run captures the same `run_id`:

```python
# personalscraper/pipeline.py — inside Pipeline.run(...)
run_id = uuid4().hex
token = current_correlation_id.set(run_id)
try:
    # … emit PipelineStarted, run every step, emit PipelineEnded …
finally:
    current_correlation_id.reset(token)
```

structlog's context binding (`bind_contextvars(run_id=...)`) is wired
in parallel at the CLI boundary (`personalscraper/commands/pipeline.py`
inside the `run` command) so log records also carry the same id.

### launchd scan bootstrap (`personalscraper library-index`)

The `library_index_command` binds `current_correlation_id` for the
duration of the scan with a fresh `run_id`. Long-lived breakers (HTTP
circuit, disk circuit) that pre-existed the scan capture this id on
emit even though they themselves were constructed earlier — the
ContextVar is read at `Event.__post_init__` time, not at breaker
construction.

### Trailers standalone bootstrap (`personalscraper trailers run`)

Same pattern. The `trailers run` Typer command binds
`current_correlation_id` around the `TrailersOrchestrator.run` call;
the YouTube breaker constructed inside the orchestrator emits
events that carry the run's id.

### Long-lived emitter scenario

A breaker constructed at module load (the `_GLOBAL_DISK_BREAKER`
singleton, for instance) has no correlation id of its own. When the
scanner calls into it from inside a `library-index` invocation, the
ContextVar resolves to the scan's `run_id` and the emitted
`CircuitBreakerOpened` carries that id. Tests pin this in
`test_circuit_breaker_long_lived_singleton_captures_correlation_id`.

## Writing a new event

1. **Decide on the module.** Domain events live in `<domain>/events.py`
   (e.g. `dispatch/events.py`, `trailers/events.py`). Pipeline-wide
   lifecycle events live in `pipeline_events.py`. Core /
   cross-cutting events live in `core/circuit.py` or
   `indexer/events.py`.
2. **Define the dataclass.**

   ```python
   from dataclasses import dataclass
   from personalscraper.core.event_bus import Event

   @dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True)
   class MyDomainEvent(Event):
       """One-line summary for the event catalog.

       Attributes:
           foo: What it carries.
           bar: What it carries.
       """

       foo: str
       bar: int
   ```

3. **Register via import.** Add the new class to the eager-import list
   in `personalscraper.events.__init__` so the class registry knows
   about it before the first `event_from_envelope` call.
4. **Add a factory.** Open `tests/fixtures/event_samples.py` and add
   the new class to `EVENT_SAMPLE_FACTORIES` with a real-data
   factory (no `MagicMock`). The `test_every_event_has_factory` gate
   fails otherwise.
5. **Write the round-trip test.** Add the class to the parametrize
   list of the envelope round-trip test in your domain's test
   module. The assertion is `event_to_envelope` then
   `event_from_envelope` reconstructs an equal instance.
6. **Update the v1 catalog table.** Append a row to the table in this
   document and to the design doc; bump the gate's expected event
   count in Phase 5.6 §7.

## Writing a new subscriber

Subscribers are simple: a class with an `__init__(bus, ...)` that
self-registers, a method per event type, and an optional `close()`
for lifecycle management.

```python
from personalscraper.core.event_bus import EventBus, SubscriptionToken
from personalscraper.pipeline_events import PipelineStarted, PipelineEnded


class MyAlerter:
    """Send a Slack message when the pipeline starts and ends."""

    name = "slack-alerter"

    def __init__(self, bus: EventBus, slack: SlackClient) -> None:
        self._slack = slack
        self._tokens: list[SubscriptionToken] = [
            bus.subscribe(PipelineStarted, self._on_start),
            bus.subscribe(PipelineEnded, self._on_end),
        ]
        self._bus = bus

    def _on_start(self, event: PipelineStarted) -> None:
        self._slack.send(f":rocket: pipeline started — {event.correlation_id}")

    def _on_end(self, event: PipelineEnded) -> None:
        self._slack.send(f":checkered_flag: pipeline ended — {event.correlation_id}")

    def close(self) -> None:
        for token in self._tokens:
            self._bus.unsubscribe(token)
```

**Lifecycle rules.**

- Self-subscribe in `__init__`; never lazy-subscribe later.
- Store every token on `self`; never let one leak.
- `close()` is the only place the subscriber removes itself.
- The CLI run command wraps subscribers in `try / finally` so
  `close()` runs even on errors.

If your subscriber needs to react to **every** event type, subscribe
to `Event` (single subscription) — the bus's MRO walk routes every
concrete subclass to your handler. `DebugLogSubscriber` is the
canonical example — fewer than 40 non-blank lines.

## Testing patterns

The bus is engineered to be cheap to test: a fresh `EventBus()` is a
no-op construction, subscribers are simple classes, and every event
class has a real-data factory in
`tests/fixtures/event_samples.py`. The patterns below are the
canonical ones used across the test tree — copying them keeps new
tests consistent with the existing project suite (run `make test` for
the current count).

There are four reusable infrastructures, each documented below: the
`CollectingSubscriber` for emit assertions, the factories registry
for parametrized tests over the full catalog, the AST boundary test
for the AppContext rule, and the required-bus signature test for
the Phase 5.2 contract. Reach for them before writing ad-hoc fakes
— each one is gated by its own test so regressions are caught
immediately.

A general note on test hygiene: every `CircuitBreaker(...)` and
every Phase 5.2-tightened entry point requires `event_bus=`
explicitly. Pass `event_bus=EventBus()` from a fixture or inline
when the test doesn't care about emit; the bus is so lightweight
that per-test instances cost nothing. The audit greps at the Phase
5 feature gate forbid any construction site without an explicit
bus, so consistency here is mechanically enforced.

### `CollectingSubscriber[E]`

A test-only subscriber that stores received events for assertions.
Live in `tests/fixtures/event_bus.py`. Used everywhere we need to
prove an emit happened without wiring a full mock:

```python

### Factories registry

`tests/fixtures/event_samples.py::EVENT_SAMPLE_FACTORIES` maps every
v1 event class to a zero-arg factory producing a realistic instance.
Tests that need to exercise every event type (round-trip,
`DebugLogSubscriber`, snapshot rendering) parametrize over this dict.
The `test_every_event_has_factory` gate prevents adding an event
without a factory.

### AST boundary test

`tests/architecture/test_app_context_boundary.py` walks every source
file and asserts that `_build_app_context` is only called from
allowlisted functions. Update the allowlist in the same commit that
introduces a new boundary — the test fails on every other
construction site. The walker also enforces that allowlisted
qualified names actually exist (no stale entries).

### Required-bus signature test

`tests/architecture/test_event_bus_required_signatures.py` parametrizes
over every Phase 5.2 tightened site and asserts (a) `event_bus`
parameter exists, (b) it has no default value, (c) the annotation
excludes `None`. Adding a new emit site means adding it to the
`REQUIRED_BUS_SITES` list so future regressions are caught
in-process, not just by the gate-time grep.

## Performance notes

The bus is engineered for tens-of-thousands of `ItemProgressed` emits
per pipeline run without becoming a bottleneck.

- **MRO cache.** Subscribe-time, each callback's target class is
  resolved once; emit-time, the bus walks the cached MRO list rather
  than recomputing `type(event).__mro__`.
- **Copy-on-write tuples.** Subscriptions live in
  `dict[type[Event], tuple[Callback, ...]]`. Adding a subscriber
  replaces the tuple; emits iterate a snapshot, so concurrent
  `subscribe` / `unsubscribe` mid-emit is safe and lock-free.
- **Zero-allocation fast path.** Events with no subscribers return
  immediately from `emit` — no list construction, no MRO walk.
- **Synchronous, in-process.** No threading, no asyncio. Subscribers
  run on the emit thread; the bus is a multicast call, not a queue.

The cost of an emit with one subscriber is dominated by the
subscriber's callback. The bus itself is a synchronous dispatch over
the cached MRO chain — at the scale used by `ItemProgressed` (a few
thousand emits per pipeline run) the overhead is irrelevant compared to
the per-item I/O of the step itself. Don't optimise emit count — write
the emit where the semantic transition happens, not "when convenient".

## Future evolution

Roadmap items that depend on the bus contract being stable but are
NOT in scope for the v1 catalog:

- **WebSocketSubscriber prototype.** Phase 1 of the future Web UI —
  subscribes to `Event`, relays envelopes over a WebSocket. Tracked
  as DESIGN §Open Questions #3; postponed to the P2 Web UI feature.
- **Outbox persistence.** The indexer already has a write-through
  outbox; extending it to a generic event-store would let the future
  Web UI replay events on reconnection. Not started.
- **Event versioning.** When the v1 catalog grows beyond 20 events
  the registry should grow a `_version` field on envelopes; today
  every consumer is in-tree so version skew is impossible.

For the rationale and decision log, see
[`docs/features/event-bus/DESIGN.md`](../features/event-bus/DESIGN.md)
§Roadmap Alignment.

The bus contract is intentionally additive: new event classes and new
subscribers can land without coordination across the codebase. The
two things that **do** require coordination are (a) renaming an
existing event class (envelope `_type` is part of the wire contract)
and (b) removing a field from an existing event (subscribers that
read the field will break). Both are PR-review-flagged regressions,
not silent migrations.
