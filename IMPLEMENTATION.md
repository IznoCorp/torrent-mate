## Design & plan review (2026-05-31, pre-implementation)

Design + plan were reviewed collaboratively before Phase 0 — more rigorous than the default flow.

**DESIGN review:**

- Interactive brainstorm → **8 decisions** resolved, each user-approved: single `media_item` creator; kind-deterministic canonical SSOT; NFO-less dirs indexed (folder-name fallback) + flagged (`item_issue`/`nfo_missing`) + proactive `doctor`/`audit` visibility; HDR/Atmos via the **existing** `media_stream` columns; `insights/` move-only; `maintenance/` = `disk_cleaner` + `rescraper`; `library-scan` visible re-pointed alias; `models.py` split by producer/consumer.
- **Adversarial self-review** (3 lenses: grounding / consistency / ACC executability) caught **2 real errors** + 8 grounding fixes:
  - HDR/Atmos columns (`hdr_format`/`is_atmos`) **already exist** (migration 004, populated by `enrich`) → decision reframed from "add columns" to "ensure enrich parity with the dropped ffprobe granularity".
  - Canonical `SEASON_DIR_RE` is **French-only** `^Saison (\d+)$`; three ad-hoc copies also match English `Season N` + `Specials` → **Phase 0 must widen before replacing** (silent-regression trap).
  - Also: `load_config` import path (`conf.loader`), `incremental.py:667` anchor, canonical trigger = manual `library-init-canonical` (not a scheduled job), completed `models.py` routing, existing `nfo_utils.py` path.
- Merged the pre-existing 619-line draft (committed in #27, v0.16→0.17, which carried the same HDR/regex errors) — best of both: its implementation-grade detail + the validated corrections.

**PLAN review:**

- 7 phases (0→6) generated, then verified for fidelity: strict 0→6 order; Phase 0 widen-first; Phase 2 parallel + characterization golden (no deletion); Phase 3 cutover (single creator, visible alias, delete `scanner.py`); Phase 4 no-new-columns + `hdr_format` parity; every phase opens with a Gate. All 16 ACC mapped.

**Outcome:** design + plan **approved**, ready for implementation. Invariants carried forward: DB end-state equality vs `library-scan` (Phase 2), 194-show + DEV#50 guards verbatim, residual-import grep = 0, `make check` per gate.

## Next action

**Phase 5** (verify/maintenance re-home + proactive no-NFO + delete `library/`). Start at `docs/features/lib-fold/plan/phase-05-verify-maintenance-delete.md`. **NOTE — `rescraper.py` + `maintenance/__init__.py` are ALREADY done** (pulled forward in Phase 4 to satisfy ACC-05 literally); Phase 5 now only needs `disk_cleaner.py` → `maintenance/`, `validator.py` → `verify/library_checks.py`, the `models.py` split (incl. `RescrapeAction`/`LibraryRescrapeResult` → `maintenance/rescraper.py`, removing the transient `library.models` import flagged with a TODO there), the proactive no-NFO doctor/audit line, and deleting `library/`.

### Phase 4 — DONE (2026-06-01, ffprobe fold + insights/; independently verified at HEAD)

- ✅ **Task 1 — HDR/Atmos parity (no gap).** The surviving pymediainfo path `indexer/mediainfo.py:_normalise_hdr_format` + `_detect_atmos` covers HDR10/HDR10+/Dolby Vision/HLG + Atmos at full parity with the dropped `analyze_library` ffprobe path. Parity regression test `tests/indexer/test_mediainfo_hdr_parity.py` (17 cases) + confirmation comment. Commit `52ef7b37`. **ACC-05b proven on real data: `library.db` has 135 `media_stream` rows with `hdr_format` populated.**
- ✅ **Tasks 2-5 — `insights/` package + DB-only repoint.** Created `personalscraper/insights/` (`models`, `analytics`, `reporter`, `recommender`); moved `analyze`/`analyze_from_index` (+ `AnalysisResult`/`ArtworkCounts`/`NfoStatusCounts` — which the plan/DESIGN §4.6 had mis-routed: they lived in `analyzer.py`, not `models.py`) + reporter + recommender. **`library-analyze`/`library-recommend`/`library-report` are now DB-only** (operator sign-off; DESIGN §4.5 — `analyze_from_index` is the sole stream reader; `--from-index` is a no-op default; commands stay visible; require a prior `library-index --mode enrich`). Deleted `analyzer.py` (incl. `analyze_library` + the inline-ffprobe path), `reporter.py`, `recommender.py` + migrated their tests to `tests/insights/`. `scraper/mediainfo.extract_stream_info` STAYS (NFO gen). Commits `c21d8c90`/`5bfd7f7d`.
- ✅ **rescraper → maintenance/ (operator-elected "force now", not a re-scope).** Rather than re-scope ACC-05 (the broad `rg extract_stream_info library/` was premature — `rescraper.py` legitimately uses it for NFO `<fileinfo>` gen, DESIGN §4.5), the operator chose to pull the Phase-5 `rescraper` move forward: `git mv library/rescraper.py → maintenance/rescraper.py` + `maintenance/__init__.py` + 6 importers re-pointed + `test_rescraper.py` → `tests/maintenance/` (77 path swaps). `RescrapeAction`/`LibraryRescrapeResult` kept in `library/models.py` for now (transient import, TODO for Phase 5 models split). **ACC-05 now passes LITERALLY** (`rg extract_stream_info library/ insights/` → rc=1). Commit `3159f117`.
- ✅ **Task 6 gate (independently re-run by main session):** `make lint` clean · `make test` **5977 passed, 0 failed/errors** · `make check` rc=0, coverage **91.73%**. Plan corrections (parity target, mis-routed dataclasses, missed test files, DB-only CLI) were validated against code and folded into the dispatches; the phase-04 plan carries a "PLAN CORRECTIONS" banner.

### Phase 3 — DONE (2026-05-31, single-creator cutover; independently verified at HEAD)

All five tasks complete; each sub-dispatch was verified against DESIGN + plan by the main session (git range, scope, quality gate re-run, honesty audit of every migrated/weakened assertion) before proceeding.

- ✅ **Task 1+2** (pre-existing): dispatch `rebuild()`/`add()` delegate to the shared `upsert_item_with_attrs` (rich rows; `canonical_provider=None` eliminated — ACC-04b ✓). Regression test `tests/dispatch/test_media_index_rich_rows.py`. Commits `3d54ba8c`/`b73a141c`/`0784850d`.
- ✅ **Task 3** — `library-scan` is now a **visible alias** of `library-index --mode full`, delegating to the shared `library_index_command(mode="full", …)` (NOT the stale plan's `commands/library/index.py` import nor a direct decorated-function call — that was a Typer `OptionInfo` trap). `tests/commands/test_library_scan.py` + `_e2e.py` rewritten to the delegation contract. Commit `5731e398`.
- ✅ **Task 4** (irreversible) — `personalscraper/library/scanner.py` **deleted** (`a487fd88`), in three verified steps: (4a) golden `test_item_stage_golden.py` **decoupled** from the live `scan_library` by freezing a verbatim-captured legacy baseline snapshot (`89267d1e`); (4b) unique scanner coverage **migrated** to `tests/indexer/scanner/_modes/test_item_stage.py` (+24 tests against `stage_library_items`/`scan_and_stage_dir`/`_detect_issues`/`_ensure_disk_row`) and `tests/test_nfo_utils.py` (+12) — full coverage-mapping table audited, `_item_stage.py` at 92.81% (`09aef064`); (4c) `test_integration.py` re-pointed to `stage_library_items`, arch `test_event_bus_required_signatures.py` entry removed, `test_scanner.py` deleted.
- ✅ **Task 5 gate (independently re-run by main session):** `make lint` clean · `make test` **5972 passed, 0 failed, 0 errors** · `make check` rc=0, **coverage 91.74%** (≥90). Module-size: only the pre-existing `movie_service.py` (975) WARN remains (out of lib-fold scope).

**Two documented incoherence-fixes (the only deviations from literal plan/DESIGN text, both signed off):**

1. **ACC-04 re-scoped** (operator sign-off — same precedent as the ACC-02 fix): the broad `rg 'library.scanner|scan_library'` → rc=1 form is **unsatisfiable** (the `trailers` subsystem has its own unrelated `Scanner.scan_library` method; `library/analyzer.py` keeps `:func:` docstrings until Phase 4; `.` is a regex wildcard). Re-scoped to the satisfiable, intent-preserving form: **file gone + no LIVE import of the deleted module** (`rg 'from personalscraper\.library\.scanner|import personalscraper\.library\.scanner'` → rc=1, verified). DESIGN.md + plan-03 synced.
2. **`library-scan --disk X` semantic shift** (DESIGN-conformant consequence of OQ-4, not a regression): the legacy alias filtered `cfg.disks` so `--disk` restricted `media_item` creation; the delegated `library-index --mode full` runs its item stage (pass 1) **library-wide** (DESIGN §4.1/§5 — `stage_items_pass1` has no `disk_filter`), so `--disk` now restricts only the file-level walk (`path`/`media_file`). No cron/launchd job uses `library-scan --disk` (DESIGN §3.6); pre-1.0, no back-compat.

## Phase 0/1/2 — corrective closure (2026-05-31, post-audit, NO DEFERRAL)

An independent adversarial audit found the original phase 0/1/2 gate commits had been stamped **before** some planned objectives/ACC were complete (false-greens at the time). Per the user's directive ("respecter le design — Option A; sans déférer"), **every gap was closed at HEAD by building exactly what DESIGN+plan specify** (not by amending the design away), then re-verified COMPLETE by a fresh independent audit (all P0/P1/P2 objectives DONE + all ACC PASS at HEAD).

**Two authorized incoherence-fixes** (the only deviations from literal DESIGN text, both documented): ACC-02 rescope (the broad form is unsatisfiable while `scan_library` lives) and the golden's **bounded** `item_issue` superset (DESIGN decision #3 mandates the new path _adds_ `nfo_missing` for NFO-less dirs — surfaced honestly by the hardened test, every other field asserted byte-identical).

**Re-gate after corrections:** `make lint` clean · `make test` **5986 passed, 0 failed** · `make check` (coverage ≥ 90 %; module-size OK <1000 — `scanner.py` dropped below 800 after the helper/`_normalize_canonical_provider` removal; registry/typed-api/pragma/CLI guardrails OK). Pre-existing `movie_service.py` (975) WARN remains (out of lib-fold scope).
