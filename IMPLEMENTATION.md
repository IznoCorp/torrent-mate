## Review cycles

### Cycle 1 — 2026-06-02

pr-review-toolkit (5 agents) + Opus filter vs DESIGN. Findings **independently
reproduced** before classification (evidence-before-severity). All are
implementation bugs within DESIGN scope — **no design contradiction**.

**Retained — blocking (must fix before merge):**

- **C1 (critical)** `_base.py` `_bencode_info_hash`: flat `data.find(b"4:info")`
  matches inside a sibling string value (`comment`/`announce`/`created by` sort
  before `info`) → crash or **silent wrong info_hash** (attacker-influenceable).
  Reproduced (crash). Fix: structural top-level dict walk.
- **C2 (critical)** `qbittorrent.py` `add()`: ignores `torrents_add` return +
  miscatches duplicate. Lib raises `Conflict409Error` on duplicate (uncaught →
  D7 broken) and returns `"Fails."` on failure (→ silent fake-success, D8
  violated). Verified vs qbittorrentapi v5.1.4. Fix: catch Conflict409 →
  idempotent; inspect return, raise on `"Fails."`; catch file/media errors.
- **M1 (major)** `qbittorrent.py` `_limit_kwargs`/`apply_limits`: `seed_time_minutes
  - 60`— qBit expects **minutes** (verified). 60× error. Test asserts the bug.
Fix: drop`\* 60`; fix test.

**Retained — medium:**

- Md1 `apply_limits` sends `-2` (reset-to-global) for the unspecified field →
  contradicts "None = no-op". Fix: only send provided fields.
- Md2 bencode not hardened (length bound / recursion depth) — folds into C1.
- Md3 base32 (32-char) magnets rejected → crash add path. Fix: accept + decode.
- Md4 `TorrentSource("")`/`from_file(b"")` pass exactly-one. Fix: reject empties.
- Md5 Transmission dup match `"duplicate" in str(exc)` fragile. Fix: `"torrent-duplicate"`.
- Md6 boot tests miss `enabled=False` + factory-raise propagation. Fix: add tests.
- Md7 doc rot: `_contracts.py` docstring + `architecture.md` say "5 protocols"
  (now 7) — DESIGN §5.2 asked to update. Fix: correct counts/tables.

**Minor (bundle opportunistically):** Transmission D6 hashString cross-check
unwired (log.warning on mismatch); `info_hash` vs `hash` param naming;
`UnsupportedCapabilityError` extends Exception (add intent comment); misleading
`patch.object(info_hash)` stub; `_errors.py` module docstring.

**Verdict:** Case B → fix phase 12 generated; run `/implement:phase`, then
re-push (CI) + re-review. PR #36 **blocked** until C1/C2/M1 fixed.
**Outcome:** phase 12 landed all fixes (commits 1fffb7b2…4521dfbe), each
independently re-verified; `make check` + design-gaps green; CI green at 47e46635.

### Cycle 2 — 2026-06-03

Focused adversarial re-review of the phase-12 fix diff (code-reviewer agent +
own adversarial bencode probing). **No regressions** — the 3 cycle-1
criticals/major are correctly fixed (bencode parser adversarially confirmed:
pieces-token-bytes, info-not-last, depth cap, length bounds, base32, empty-guard
all pass). Two residual findings, both **confirmed by hand**:

- **MEDIUM** `qbittorrent.py` `add()` catches `LoginFailed` for "401" but a real
  401 on `torrents_add` is `Unauthorized401Error` (distinct MRO) → escapes
  uncaught; docstring over-claims "401 → ApiError". Verified: a simulated
  `Unauthorized401Error` escapes `add()`.
- **MINOR** `transmission.py` `add()` `"torrent-duplicate"` except branch is
  effectively dead with the installed lib (a dup returns a `Torrent`, no raise);
  a daemon that raised would say `"duplicate torrent"` (not `"torrent-duplicate"`).
  Its test mocks an unrealistic raise.

**Verdict:** Case B → fix phase 13 (401 catch + Transmission dup robustness).

### Cycle 3 — 2026-06-03

Full adversarial multi-agent review (7 dimension reviewers + per-finding
skeptic verification; 27 findings, 0 refuted) followed by an evidence-based
severity calibration. No critical/high defects survived verification; the
cycle-1/2 fixes (bencode C1 structural walk, qBit Conflict409 idempotence,
seed-time minutes, Unauthorized401 catch) were independently re-confirmed
correct. Six items fixed (operator chose "fix everything"):

- **boot-coupling (review #1/#2/#5)** — `_build_app_context` /
  `per_step_boundary` gained a keyword-only `build_torrent_client` flag
  (default False). Only `run` / `ingest` / `torrents_list` set it True. Read-
  only commands (`library *`, `trailers`, `maintenance`) no longer connect +
  log in to the torrent daemon at boot, so a configured-but-unreachable daemon
  (or a stale-cred login writing a 1-hour auth lockout that would block the
  next ingest) can no longer break a command that never consumes
  `ctx.torrent_client`. DESIGN D9 amended to document the scoping; regression
  test `test_read_only_command_skips_torrent_build` + ACC-14.
- **qBit add() return type (review #3)** — success check made robust to a
  non-str `TorrentsAddedMetadata` return (qBit Web API v2.14.0+): a non-str
  result is success (HTTP failures already raise), only a str is matched
  against `"Ok."`. Prevents misreporting a successful add as `ApiError`.
  Regression test `test_add_metadata_object_return_is_success`.
- **D5 round-trip guard (review #6)** — `TransmissionClient.add` now raises
  `ValueError` for `category=None` + non-empty `tags` (unrepresentable in the
  flat-labels round-trip; the read side would promote the first tag to
  category). DESIGN D5 amended; tests `test_category_none_with_tags_raises` +
  `test_d5_round_trip_stable_for_supported_inputs`.
- **doc/ACC hygiene (review #4/#7/#8/#9/#10/#11)** — ACCEPTANCE absolute test
  counts replaced with `0 failed` assertions (SH-16 re-exercise stability);
  DESIGN D7 + qbittorrent-api.md corrected (duplicate = Conflict409, not
  `"Fails."`; `-2` sentinel removed; 401 catches both exceptions); reference
  section version headers `v0.20.0` → `v0.21.0` (+ feature_map anchor regen);
  `_base.py` + two test docstrings `5 atomic` → `7`.

`make check` exit 0 (6016 passed, 0 failed, coverage 91.26%), `make lint`
clean, `audit_design_coverage --strict` 0 findings, `update_feature_map
--check` clean, all ACC-01..ACC-14 re-exercised green, smoke v0.21.0.

### Phase 15 — Dispatch external-ID matching (out-of-scope addition) — 2026-06-03

Folded into this PR at the operator's explicit request (a `pipeline-monitor` run
surfaced the anomaly). **Out of original RP1 scope** (RP1 = torrent write capability
on `api/torrent/`; this touches `personalscraper/dispatch/`) — documented as a
sign-off deviation in DESIGN §11.

**Anomaly:** DISPATCH matched a staging item to its on-disk folder by normalized
**folder name only**. `Rick and Morty (2013)` (staging, TVDB 275274) did not match the
on-disk `Rick et Morty (2006)` (same TVDB 275274) → would dispatch as a **new** folder,
**splitting** the show. Generalizes to any legacy-mis-named on-disk show getting a new season.

**Change (TDD):** `MediaIndex.find()` gains a provider-id pass between exact-name and
fuzzy — on a name miss it matches the staging NFO's **canonical provider id** (TVDB shows /
TMDB movies) against the on-disk entry's `external_ids_json`. New `item_repo.find_by_external_id`.
Threaded via `dispatcher._resolve_existing_on_filesystem` + `_tv.py`/`_movie.py`. Doc:
`storage.md#move-rules-dispatch` + paired contract test; `dispatch.json` regenerated.

**Adversarial review (3 reviewers) → 3 findings fixed, each with a regression test:**

- **HIGH (2-reviewer consensus)** — placeholder-id poisoning: a leaked `tvdb=0` / `imdb=None`
  would false-match any row carrying the same placeholder → wrong merge/replace. Fixed: repo
  rejects placeholder series_ids (`""`/`0`/`none`). Test `test_placeholder_imdb_id_does_not_false_match`.
- **MED-HIGH** — ambiguous id (two folders, one id): `LIMIT 1` newest-wins silently. Fixed:
  warn `indexer.dispatch.external_id_ambiguous`. Test `test_ambiguous_external_id_resolves_to_one_existing_entry`.
- **MED** — drift fallback re-keyed on the staging name, discarding a drifted id-match → re-split.
  Fixed: the per-disk rescan also probes the matched entry's basename.

Evidence (live `library.db`): 90.8% of 1934 rows already carry IDs (shows 93.6% tvdb, movies
88% tmdb); `Rick et Morty (2006)` (id 1381) carries tvdb 275274 → matched today, no backfill
needed for it. The 177 blank rows backfilled via `library-init-canonical` (phase 15 step).
Acceptance: **ACC-15**.

### Phase 16 — Metadata search NFC-normalization (out-of-scope addition) — 2026-06-03

Folded into this PR at the operator's request (a `library-rescrape` of legacy
catalog items surfaced the bug). **Out of original RP1 scope** (touches
`api/metadata/`, not `api/torrent/`) — documented sign-off deviation, same basis as
phase 15.

**Bug (found via systematic-debugging):** accented French film titles
(`L'âge de glace`, `Le Garçon et la Bête`, …) returned **zero** TMDB/TVDB search
results and silently became `no_match`, even though the provider has the film.
Root cause proven by reproduction: folder names on the macOS / NTFS-via-macFUSE
filesystem are stored **NFD-decomposed** (`a` + U+0302 combining circumflex); the
search query was passed **verbatim** to the provider, whose index is **NFC** →
no match. `search RAW(NFD) → 0 results` vs `search NFC → 2 results`. ASCII titles
(Aladdin) were unaffected; the fuzzy _matching_ layer already accent-folds, but the
_search query_ was never normalized — the gap.

**Fix (TDD):** NFC-normalize the search query at the provider boundary —
`TMDBClient._search_paginated` (covers movie+tv) and `TVDBClient.search_series` /
`search_movie`. Idempotent for ASCII / already-NFC → zero regression. Regression
tests `test_query_is_nfc_normalized` (TMDB + TVDB). Verified end-to-end: the
`movies_animation` bulk re-scrape went from **Fixed 1 → Fixed 13** (all accented
titles now match at confidence 1.0). `make check` green, design-gaps `--strict`
0 findings, smoke ok. Acceptance: **ACC-16**.

> Side-findings (operational, not code): (a) `library-init-canonical` reads the
> folder-name NFO (`Aladdin (1992).nfo`) not the canonical `<title>.nfo`, so it
> missed re-scraped IDs — worked around by a targeted DB `external_ids_json`
> UPDATE reusing `_nfo_metadata_for_dir` + `derive_canonical_provider` (cohort
> video-blank 107 → 35). (b) The scanner's Merkle/mtime change-detection does not
> see in-place NFO rewrites on NTFS (incremental + full both short-circuited).
> Both are candidates for a future indexer fix.

### Phase 17 — Unify the TV source-aware fetch (out-of-scope addition) — 2026-06-03

Folded into this PR at the operator's request after a `library-rescrape` of old
French/classic shows (Hey Arnold!, Tintin, Famille Pirate, Il était une fois…)
aborted with `tmdb API 404`. **Out of original RP1 scope** (touches `scraper/` +
`maintenance/`) — documented sign-off deviation, same basis as phases 15–16.

**Bug (found via systematic-debugging, after a first mis-localized attempt that
was reverted):** the maintenance rescraper is a **divergent copy** of the TV
scrape — `_resolve_tmdb_id` dropped `match.source` and the rescraper fed the
matched **TVDB** id to `tmdb.get_tv` → 404 → the whole item aborted, even though
TVDB had the show. The operator's diagnosis was the real root cause: **the scrape
logic was duplicated** (`tv_service`, `existing_validator`, and this rescraper),
so the TVDB-primary discipline could diverge.

**Fix (option C, designed via a Workflow that mapped all three copies; TDD):**
extract the source-aware fetch slice — `fetch_show_data(source, api_id, provider,
…)` in `_tvdb_convert.py` — the TVDB-primary / TMDB-fallback branch lifted
verbatim from `tv_service._lookup_series:501-526`. **Both** `tv_service` and the
rescraper now call it, so the discipline lives in ONE place. The rescraper carries
`match.source` through `_resolve_tmdb_id` (NFO path now uses `extract_nfo_metadata`,
tvdb-present → tvdb) and routes episodes to the shared `_fetch_season_episodes_tvdb`
/ `_fetch_season_episodes` twins. Regression test `test_tvdb_only_show_scrapes_via_tvdb_not_tmdb`.
Verified end-to-end: anime re-scrape **Errors 8 → 0, Fixed 0 → 8** (Hey Arnold! /
Tintin now scrape via TVDB). `make check` green (959 in scraper+maintenance+e2e),
design-gaps `--strict` 0 findings, residual `tmdb.get_tv(` in `maintenance/` = 0.
Acceptance: **ACC-17**.

> The **full** unification (option B — extract the whole `_lookup_series` match +
> title-resolve into a shared core so `tv_service` / `existing_validator` /
> rescraper stop duplicating it) is deferred to a dedicated feature and logged in
> ROADMAP.md (Tech-Debt Round 2): it touches the pipeline scrape path + ~6000
> tests, too large for a fix-phase. Phase 17 unified the seam that caused the bug.

## Next action

**All phases (1–17) complete.** Cycle-1 (C1/C2/M1 + 7 mediums), cycle-2 (qBit
401 catch, Transmission dup robustness) and cycle-3 (boot-coupling scope, qBit
metadata return, D5 guard, doc/ACC hygiene) fixes all landed and independently
re-verified. `make check` 6016 passed, design-gaps `--strict` 0 findings, smoke
v0.21.0. Re-push PR #36 + CI; review loop converged (cycle-3 adversarial pass
confirmed no critical/high defects survive). **Phase 15** (dispatch external-ID
matching) then landed on top with its own 3-reviewer adversarial pass (3 findings
fixed, each with a regression test). **Phase 16** (metadata search NFC-normalization)
landed next via systematic-debugging (root cause reproduced, TDD fix, verified
end-to-end). **Phase 17** (unify the TV source-aware fetch) followed — designed via
a Workflow mapping the three duplicated scrape paths, fixing the TVDB-only 404 abort
at its root (de-duplication). Re-run the full gate, re-push PR #36 + CI, then
**manual merge**.

> **Phase 9 re-scope (documented):** the plan estimated 3 files; reality was 23 — `run_ingest`'s
> signature change rippled through `pipeline_steps.py` (IngestStep/LegacyCallableStep — missed by
> the plan, would have broken the live pipeline) + ~20 test call sites. Phase 9 also fixed a
> Phase-8 boot-fail-fast regression (56 trailers/indexer CLI tests with bare-MagicMock configs
> tripping the fail-fast) — verified pre-existing at baseline SHA 9a9eac1d via a worktree run.
> Net: zero new failures, full suite green.
