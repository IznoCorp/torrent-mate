"""Pure send-keys delivery primitives: the pane classifier + the ordered key sequence.

Functional core — no I/O, no imports below :mod:`core` (the layering guard enforces this). This
module owns the PURE decisions of the interactive launch flow that the PoC ``engine/launch.py``
made: classifying a ``tmux capture-pane`` snapshot into ``trust`` / ``ready`` / ``pending``, and
building the ordered ``send-keys`` actions that drive a fresh interactive ``claude`` (dismiss the
trust dialog if seen, then type the filled prompt literally, then submit with Enter).

Ported faithfully from the PoC at
``PersonalScraper/.claude/skills/kanban/kanbanmate/engine/launch.py``:
``_TRUST_MARKER`` / ``_REPL_READY_MARKERS`` / ``_TRUST_POLL_ATTEMPTS`` / ``_TRUST_POLL_INTERVAL``
(L27-44) and ``build_sendkeys_sequence`` (L47-77). The PoC's ``poll_trust_dialog`` is the bounded
capture-pane poll; here the PURE half is :func:`classify_pane` (the per-snapshot verdict) and the
poll LOOP lives in the app layer (which owns the I/O of ``capture`` + the injected sleeper).
