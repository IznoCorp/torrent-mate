"""Command-pattern actions: the imperative side-effects of one tick (DESIGN §3.3).

:func:`kanbanmate.core.decide.decide` produces a pure :class:`~kanbanmate.core.domain.Action`
describing *what* to do; this module holds the four command objects that know *how* to do it.
Each action carries only its own ``Ticket`` and is executed against an injected :class:`Deps`
bundle, so the actions speak exclusively to ``ports`` Protocols and never name a concrete
adapter (that is :mod:`kanbanmate.app.wiring`'s job).

The behaviours are ported from the PoC ``engine/launch.py`` (LaunchAction),
``engine/teardown.py`` (TeardownAction / ResetAction), and ``engine/reaper.py`` (the reap step
that the tick wraps in a TeardownAction). The PoC's n8n / webhook-payload / HMAC bits are
dropped entirely — the polling diff is the only ingress now (DESIGN §3.1).

Layering: ``app`` may import ``core``, ``ports`` and ``adapters`` but MUST NOT import ``cli``
or ``daemon`` (DESIGN §3.2). These actions import only ``core`` + ``ports``.

    """Injected adapter bundle the command actions execute against.

    Frozen so an action can never mutate its dependency wiring mid-tick. Every field is a
    ``ports`` Protocol — the concrete adapters are assembled once in
    :func:`kanbanmate.app.wiring.build_deps`. ``base`` and ``agent_command`` are small policy
    knobs threaded through so the launch flow stays a pure function of its inputs.

    Attributes:
        board_writer: Board write side (``move_card`` / ``comment``).
        board_reader: Board read side (``cheap_probe`` / ``snapshot``); held so an action that
            needs a fresh read can use it without a second wiring path.
        workspace: Per-ticket git-worktree management.
        sessions: Detached tmux session lifecycle.
        store: Persisted per-ticket runtime state.
        clock: Wall-clock source (injected for deterministic tests).
        pull_requests: PR close side (Cancel teardown only; DESIGN §8.2). The
            same concrete ``GithubClient`` instance that backs ``board_writer``
            satisfies it, so one client is wired into both ports.
        base: The integration base branch the per-ticket WIP branch is first created off.
        agent_command: DEAD knob (minor (d)). NOTHING reads it: ``LaunchAction._agent_command``
            ALWAYS builds the bare ``claude`` argv via ``build_claude_argv``. Retained only so existing
            ``Deps(...)`` / ``WiringConfig.agent_command`` threading compile; do NOT add a consumer.
        profile: DEAD knob (minor (d)). The launch resolves its profile from the matched TRANSITION's
            ``profile`` ONLY (:meth:`LaunchAction._resolve_profile`, DESIGN §8.0.6), never from this
            global. Retained only so existing constructions compile; unused by every path.
        repo: The board's ``owner/name`` slug, exported as ``KANBAN_REPO`` into a transition script's
            env (:class:`RunScriptAction`). Defaulted ``""``; threaded from :attr:`WiringConfig.repo`.
        session_end_bin: The ``kanban-session-end`` shim appended after the launched ``claude``
            command (``claude … ; kanban-session-end <issue>``). Defaults to ``"kanban-session-end"``
            (the installed console-script on PATH); a real wiring may pass the absolute path.
        kanban_root: The launching daemon's runtime root (e.g. ``~/.kanban-km``). When non-empty it is
            exported as ``KANBAN_ROOT`` on the launched command so the trailing ``; kanban-session-end``
            AND the agent's kanban-* helpers target the CORRECT root, not the hardcoded ``~/.kanban``
            (km-root bug, #1). Empty (the default daemon) leaves the command byte-identical.
        config_dir: The project's ``.claude`` directory — the source of ``skills``/``commands``/
            ``agents`` the launch COPIES into the worktree so the agent resolves the ``/implement:*``
            skills its prompt invokes. Empty skips provisioning. Threaded from
            :attr:`WiringConfig.config_dir`.
        status_reporter: The rolling project status-update side of the board (phase-24 §24.3). The
            ``GithubClient`` that backs ``board_writer`` satisfies it; consumed only by
            :func:`kanbanmate.app.status_reporter.report_status`. Defaulted to a no-op reporter.
        health_reporter: The per-card Health single-select side of the board (health-field). The same
            ``GithubClient`` backs it; consumed only by
            :func:`kanbanmate.app.health_reporter.apply_health`. Defaulted to a no-op.
        project_id: The board's ``ProjectV2`` node id, threaded so the status reporter can
            ``create_status_update`` on it. Threaded from :attr:`WiringConfig.project_id`; defaulted ``""``.
        sleeper: The blocking-sleep boundary the launch's trust/ready poll waits on between
            ``capture-pane`` snapshots (phase-25 §25.1). Production wires :func:`time.sleep`; tests
            inject a no-op so the bounded poll runs offline. Defaulted to :func:`time.sleep`.

    """Start a Claude Code agent for a ticket that entered an agent column.

    Ported from the PoC ``engine/launch.py`` ``start_session`` (the n8n/payload bits dropped):

    1. ensure the per-ticket worktree exists on its WIP branch ``kanban/ticket-<n>`` (idempotent);
    2. materialise the permission profile into ``<worktree>/.claude/settings.json`` (DESIGN
       §10) so the agent boots under a pinned mode + concrete allow/deny — merge stays
       human-only, force-push and history rewrite are denied;
    3. launch a detached tmux session ``ticket-<n>`` running the agent command in that worktree;
    4. persist the running :class:`TicketState` (session id, item id, heartbeat=now) so the
       reaper can later find and age the agent;
    5. post a sticky "started" comment when the ticket has an issue number.

    The order matters: the worktree and session exist *before* state is persisted, so a crash
    between steps never records a running ticket with no live session (the reaper would block it
    on the next tick — safe, not silently wrong).

    Per-transition routing (phase 12; delivery restored to PoC parity in phase-25 §25.1). The
    matched whitelist transition's routing is carried on the action itself (NOT on :class:`Deps`,
    which holds only static policy knobs). The launch ALWAYS starts a BARE ``claude`` (no positional
    prompt — :meth:`_agent_command`). When :attr:`prompt` is set, the launch then FILLS it
    (``{{code}}`` / ``{{title}}`` / … substituted via :func:`kanbanmate.core.placeholders.fill`)
    and SEND-KEYS the filled ``/implement:*`` prompt INTO the live REPL (:meth:`_deliver_prompt`,
    after a bounded trust/ready poll) — the headline parity fix (the PoC typed the prompt into the
    agent's own session + pressed Enter; the intervening genesis regression appended it as claude's
    POSITIONAL message, which opened the REPL but never SUBMITTED it, so the agent sat idle and got
    reaped). When :attr:`prompt` is ``None`` the bare ``claude`` session boots without an injected
    first message (back-compat).

    The remaining transition routing (:attr:`script`, :attr:`on_fail`, :attr:`advance`) is carried
    for phase 13's script-gate + auto-advance / on_fail consumption; phase 12 only fills + launches.

    **Transition-only permission resolution (genesis phase 20 — FAIL-LOUD).** The profile the
    agent runs under is resolved by :meth:`_resolve_profile` from the matched **transition**'s
    :attr:`profile` (``transitions.yml``) ONLY — the agent launches AT the transition, so its
    profile comes from the transition (DESIGN §8.0.6). There is NO per-column default tier and NO
    silent global (the PoC model: permissions resolved by the ``(from, to)`` transition, not one
    global ``Deps.profile``).

    When :attr:`profile` is empty the launch FAILS LOUD (:meth:`execute` raises ``ValueError``
    BEFORE any worktree/session is created) — it NEVER silently falls back to :attr:`Deps.profile`
    (which is now a legacy/test-only knob; see :attr:`Deps.profile`). The §10 safety floor is
    intact: the resolved profile still flows through
    :func:`~kanbanmate.adapters.perms.materialise_settings` /
    :func:`~kanbanmate.core.launch_argv.build_claude_argv`, which reject a bypass mode.

    Attributes:
        ticket: The ticket that entered the agent column.
        prompt: The matched transition's launch prompt template. When set, it is FILLED and
            SEND-KEYS'd into the live REPL after launch (the per-transition ``/implement:*`` prompt;
            :meth:`_deliver_prompt`, phase-25 §25.1); ``None`` boots a bare ``claude`` with no
            injected first message.

        profile: The matched **transition**'s permission profile — the SOLE profile source
            (transitions-only model, DESIGN §8.0.6). FAILS LOUD when empty (no column default, no

    Ported from the PoC ``engine/teardown.py`` ``teardown_ticket`` to full parity — the seven
    local steps plus the remote PR close:

    1. kill the tmux session (guarded — ``Sessions.kill`` raises on an absent session);
    2. remove the worktree with ``--force`` (a cancelled worktree is almost always dirty);
    3. force-delete the local feature branch (``git branch -D`` via the workspace seam; skip
       ``""``/``"HEAD"`` AND the per-ticket WIP branch ``kanban/ticket-<n>``, PRESERVED so a
       cancelled ticket's committed design/plan survives — DESIGN §13) — subprocess in the adapter;
    4. release the concurrency slot (idempotent; the fs store also purges the persisted state);
    5. flip any OPEN stage stickies to their terminal status (❌ cancelled, or ✅ done for the
       Done-arrival flavour — DESIGN §8.2.c / phase 28.1);
    6. close the open PR for the branch (KEEP the remote branch — close ≠ delete-ref);
    7. post a final recap comment so the timeline records the teardown.

    Two FLAVOURS share this one path (:attr:`flavour`): ``"cancel"`` (default — ABANDONMENT: ❌
    ``cancelled`` stickies + a Backlog-re-arm recap; the historical behaviour, unchanged) and
    ``"done"`` (the phase-28.1 Done-arrival teardown — the card landed in Done while its agent was
    LIVE, so the work is complete: ✅ ``done`` stickies + a short "moved to Done — agent torn down"
    recap with NO Backlog re-arm; the card STAYS in Done, the tick does NOT move it).

    Every step is **fail-soft** (mirroring the PoC ``_soft`` helper): a single step's failure is
    logged and never aborts the remaining steps. The flow is also **replay-safe** — a second
    teardown destroys nothing and never raises. Replay-safety is ENFORCED at the source (phase
    28.1): the worktree-touching steps (branch discovery + worktree removal) are gated on
    :meth:`~kanbanmate.ports.workspace.Workspace.worktree_exists`, so an ALREADY-GONE worktree is
    SKIPPED rather than producing noisy ``git -C <gone>`` exit-128 ERROR logs. The guard is on the
    SHARED path, so BOTH flavours benefit (the Cancel flavour's earlier e2e finding is fixed too).

    Teardown runs in the dispatcher (no agent, no ``.claude/settings.json``), so the deny-list
    that bans ``git branch -D`` / merges for LAUNCHED AGENTS does not apply — this single
    mechanical transition is the only path that destroys, and it never deletes anything remote
    beyond CLOSING the PR (the remote branch is kept, DESIGN §8.2).

    Attributes:
        ticket: The ticket to tear down.
        keep_budgets: When ``True``, the purge PRESERVES the per-issue budgets
            (``moves/`` rate-limit history + ``retries/`` fix-CI counters) — used
            by the reaper's stale-agent teardown (13.8) so the durable §6
            rate-limit accumulates across reaps. The default ``False`` is the
            exhaustive teardown that the Cancel column uses (the ticket is
            abandoned, so its budgets are dropped too).
        flavour: ``"cancel"`` (default — abandonment wording + ❌ stickies), ``"done"``
            (phase-28.1 Done-arrival — ✅ stickies + a short "moved to Done" recap, NO Backlog
            re-arm), or ``"reap"`` (defect 5 — the reaper's stale-agent park-in-Blocked: kill the
            session + purge state + finalize ⛔ ONLY, NON-DESTRUCTIVE — NO worktree removal, NO
            branch delete, NO PR close, PoC ``reaper._move_to_blocked`` parity). The ``cancel`` and
