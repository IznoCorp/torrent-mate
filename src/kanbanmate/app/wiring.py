"""Composition root: build concrete adapters and assemble :class:`Deps` (DESIGN §3.3).

This is the **only** ``app`` module permitted to name concrete adapter classes. Everywhere else
(``tick``, ``actions``) speaks ``ports`` Protocols, so the wiring stays the single seam where the
hexagon's inside meets its outside (DESIGN §3.2). Given a :class:`WiringConfig`, :func:`build_deps`
constructs the GitHub board client, the filesystem state store, the git-worktree workspace, the
tmux sessions adapter, and a real wall-clock, then bundles them into the :class:`Deps` the
actions execute against.

Layering: ``app`` may import ``adapters`` (DESIGN §3.2); this module does, deliberately. It must
not import ``cli`` or ``daemon`` (the entrypoints sit *above* the composition root).

    """The runtime configuration needed to build every concrete adapter.

    A thin, typed value object the daemon/CLI fills from ``~/.kanban/`` config + the per-repo
    ``columns.yml``. Keeping it explicit (rather than reading the environment inside the adapters)
    preserves the functional-core / imperative-shell boundary: I/O sources are named here, once.

    Attributes:
        token: A GitHub PAT scoped ``project`` + ``repo`` (DESIGN §10).
        project_id: The ``ProjectV2`` node id of the board to drive.
        repo: The ``owner/name`` slug used to resolve issues for comments.
        clone_dir: The local clone all per-ticket worktrees are siblings of.
        columns_yaml: The raw ``columns.yml`` document; parsed once into the column model.
        kanban_root: The state-store root; defaults to ``~/.kanban/`` when ``None``.
        base: The integration base branch new worktrees check out detached.
        agent_command: The shell command launched inside each agent's tmux session.
        kill_switch: When ``True`` (``~/.kanban/PAUSE`` present) every launch is blocked.
        transitions_yaml: The raw ``transitions.yml`` document from the clone's
            ``.claude/kanban/transitions.yml``; ``None`` when the clone ships none, in which
            case :func:`build_tick_config` falls back to the built-in
            :data:`~kanbanmate.core.transitions_defaults.DEFAULT_TRANSITIONS` so a whitelist is
            ALWAYS supplied (DESIGN §8.0.6) — never a column model.
        config_dir: The project's ``.claude`` directory (skills/commands/agents source) the
            launch COPIES into each worktree so the agent resolves its ``/implement:*`` skills
            (phase 14.6). Threaded onto :attr:`~kanbanmate.app.actions.Deps.config_dir`; an empty
            value disables provisioning. Filled from the registry's ``config_dir`` by the daemon's
            ``_wiring_from_registry``. (The registry's ``dev_repo_path`` does NOT reach here — it
            is consumed only by the post-merge ``kanban-update-main`` path, which reads it off the
            registry directly, so it never needs to thread through the tick.)
